            question:
                "When should I start planning to study abroad from India?",

            answer:
                "It is generally useful to start planning well before your intended intake so you have time to research destinations and universities, prepare required tests and documents, review deadlines and organize your finances. The appropriate timeline varies by country, university and program."
        },

        {
            question:
                "How do I choose the right country to study abroad?",

            answer:
                "Consider the availability of your preferred course, universities, admission requirements, tuition fees, living costs, scholarships, application timelines and your personal priorities. Comparing these factors can help you create a more informed shortlist."
        },

        {
            question:
                "How do I choose a university for studying abroad?",

            answer:
                "Start by identifying programs that match your academic goals. Then compare the curriculum, admission requirements, tuition, location, available facilities, application deadlines and other factors that matter to you. Always verify current information directly with the university before applying."
        },

        {
            question:
                "What are the common requirements for studying abroad?",

            answer:
                "Requirements vary by destination, institution, program and applicant. Depending on your situation, you may need academic records, identification documents, language-test results, a statement of purpose, recommendation letters, financial documentation and other supporting documents."
        },

        {
            question:
                "Do I need IELTS or TOEFL to study abroad?",

            answer:
                "Some universities and programs require proof of English-language proficiency, while requirements and accepted tests can differ. Check the official requirements of each university and program you are considering."
